# Dear Yabi
To turn this boi on, do the following
1. Remove the QR Code from the Lid
2. Open the lid and locate the microcontroller floating inside
3. Flip the tiny switch on the side of the microcontroller
4. Turn over the microcontroller and press the reset button
5. Close the lid carefully
6. Read the screen that should turn on
7. Profit

After profiting by **fully** activating the device, come back and read the bottom of this page.

 # Welcome to the bottom of the page
 Make sure you have fully activated and shaken the device before going further.
 
 Dear Yabi,
 
 It's been great seeing you go full send to become a certified coding and electronics god in the future. I know that you're planning on becoming  
 ## Him  
 over IAP, so I thought I'd give you a headstart to hype you up and make sure you get there. I know you're going to be working on youre boosted watch for projX, which is a lot of new stuff to learn. I want this device to be 
 1) Kinda cool as is
 2) More importantly, give you a framework for how you could potentially approach coding and wiring your wristband
 
 I made this boi in about 6 hrs, including 2 hrs. debugging interrupts on the accelerometer (which I didn't end up using lol), and I made sure to comment my code so you could learn from it. By the end of IAP (at the absolute latest) you should be able to read through my code and understand it, so you can see some ways of making your watch code readable and functional as fast as possible, and as robust as possible.
 
 You're killing it out there already in 6.004, and I'm sure a class like 6.115 is somewhere in your future, after which all microcontrollers will bend to your will. In the meantime, leverage your resources - you've got a lot of cool people who know how to make cool stuff on hall, as well as people and lab spaces all over campus that are willing to help if you ask. 
 
 Also I've got way more hardware than I have time to make goofy stuff with so just ask and you shall receive.
 
 Looking forward to seeing what you're capable of, and I hope to be around as a grad student to see it in person.
  -ya boi :>
